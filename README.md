Introduction

Welcome to the Surveillance Drone ROS2 Project! This project aims to develop a versatile and efficient surveillance drone using the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). The drone is equipped with an array of sensors and cameras to enhance its surveillance capabilities and provide comprehensive environmental monitoring.
Features

    IMU Sensor: Provides accurate orientation, acceleration, and angular velocity data, essential for stable flight and maneuverability.
    Sonar Sensor: Measures distance to objects and terrain, enabling obstacle avoidance and safe navigation.
    Front Camera: Captures high-resolution video and images from the drone's forward-facing perspective, suitable for real-time monitoring and recording.
    Bottom Camera: Provides visual data of the area directly below the drone, useful for detailed ground inspection and target tracking.

This README provides an overview of the project's structure, setup instructions, and usage guidelines to help you get started with developing and deploying the surveillance drone.
